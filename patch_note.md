## [1.01] - 2024-10-27

### Added
- Added an option to enter a Thai name for both the Owner and Tenant.
- The system now automatically selects "Passport" or "ID card" based on the nationality of the Owner and Tenant.
- Floor numbers now display with ordinal suffixes (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).

### Fixed
- Fixed a display bug where owner information would incorrectly appear behind the passport expiration date field.
- Corrected an issue that caused empty parentheses "()" to appear in the page footer.

### Changed
- Removed commas from numbers in all English-language text to improve consistency (e.g., 1000 instead of 1,000).
